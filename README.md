BattleBots
===

### What?
This is an experiment to help people learn to program by programming competitive bots and facing them off against 
each other.

### Why?
My friends love to play games and are competitive, but many avoid learning to program because it's too boring. 
There are a number of similar projects online that teach people to code via programming games, but it's usually 
oriented towards smaller children and slow-paced. I want to build something with a little less hand-holding.

### todo
There's a lot! This is just the beginning:
	- fix breaking bugs (many of them)
	- get some sort of online multiplayer system
		- probably with Node
		- there's a lot of issues about this sort of thing I don't fully understand
